                  As the lead full stack developer I am responsible for all
                  software development, and QA. This is for the front end, APIs,
                  and the back end. Additionally I was tasked with identifying
                  and analyzing weak points in the workflows. Each project had
                  to be estimated and prioritized based on its workload and
                  immediate impact to efficiency.
