# Ayush Goyal - Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website! This project was built using Next.js and is deployed on Vercel. Below, you'll find information about the project structure, how to run it locally, and some additional notes.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `pages/`: Contains the pages of the website. Each file represents a different page.
- `components/`: Houses reusable components used across different pages.
- `public/`: Contains static assets like images, icons, etc.
- `styles/`: Holds global and component-specific styles.
