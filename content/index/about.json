    "description": "Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge by diving into Next.js and Solidity. Next.js is a powerful framework that enables server-side rendering and provides a seamless development experience for building modern web applications. It allows me to deliver high-performance and SEO-friendly websites. On the other hand, Solidity, the programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, excites me as it empowers me to develop decentralized applications that can transform traditional business processes.
